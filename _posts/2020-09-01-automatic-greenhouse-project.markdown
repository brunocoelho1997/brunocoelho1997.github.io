When I was 18 years old, I already had some programming skills. So, as a final project of my course, I decided to develop an automatic greenhouse using Arduino and PHP.


## Features
The automatic greenhouse was developed to be easy to install and use. Was only necessary to:
* Connect it to 220v,
* Connect it to local network using ethernet cable,
* Turn on the automatic greenhouse,
* Control it using a web interface.

As it's possible to see on the next picture, on the main page is displayed:
* Actual temperature,
* Actual humidity,
* The watering state,
* and finally, if the smart watering was enabled or not.

For the smart watering feature, the user was allowed to:
* Configure the automatic watering time (how much time the watering system would be turned on - in minutes),
* Turn on/off the automatic watering system,
* Program when the watering system would be turned on (when the automatic watering system was enabled).

The automatic greenhouse project also had some other features, like:
* Configure the manual watering time (in minutes),
* Activate/deactivate in real-time the watering system (manual trigger),
* And query for the last recorded data of water, temperature, and humidity.
