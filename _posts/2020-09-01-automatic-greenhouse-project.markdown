When I was 18 years old, I already had some programming skills. So, as a final project of my course, I decided to develop an automatic greenhouse using Arduino and PHP.


## Features
Was developed to be easy to install and use the automatic greenhouse. Was only necessary to:
* Connect the automatic greenhouse to 220v
* Connect the automatic greenhouse to ethernet cable
* Turn on the automatic greenhouse
* Control it using a web interface.

As it's possible to see on the next picture, on the main page is displayed:
* Actual temperature
* Actual humidity
* The watering state
* and finally, if the smart watering was enabled or not

For this last feature, that is, the smart watering, the user was enabled to configure:
* Configure the manual/automatic watering time
* Turn on/off the automatic watering system
* Program when the watering system would be turned on (when the automatic watering system was enabled)

The automatic greenhouse project also had some other features, like:
* Activate/deactivate in real-time the watering system (manual watering)
* and query for last recorded data of water, temperature, and humidity
