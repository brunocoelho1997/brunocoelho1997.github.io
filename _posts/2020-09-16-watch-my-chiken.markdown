During the day, chickens like to stay in the sun as we do! However, during the night, we have to keep them safe. To tackle that and simplify the job of manually closing a gate every night, I decided to create something that would do it for me - and that’s why I created this project. It’s working 24/7 since December 2019 :)

## Description

To save money, I used an old gate motor and reused a group of electronics. To avoid the changing hour (winter/summer) I used a photocell to open/close the gate depending on the amount of light. Watch the final result in the following video.
