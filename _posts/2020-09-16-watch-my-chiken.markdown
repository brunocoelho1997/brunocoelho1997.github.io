During the day, chickens like to stay in the sun as we do! However, at the night we have to keep them safe.  In order of that, and to simplify the job of closing a gate every night, I decided to create something that made it for me - and that’s how this project was created. It’s working 24/7 since December 2019 :)

## Description

In order to save money, was used an old gate motor and reused a group of electronics. 
To avoid the changing hour (winter/summer) was used a photocell that open/close the gate depending on the amount of light. 
Watch the final result on the following video.
