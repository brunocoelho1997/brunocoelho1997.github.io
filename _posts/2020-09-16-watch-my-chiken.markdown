During the day, the chickens like to stay in the sun as we do! But at night, they go to the coop. However, sometimes exists predators that kill them at night, so it's necessary to stay them safe. In order for my parent's chickens to be safe at night, was necessary every day to close a gate.
Since that job was mine (close the gate), I decided that I have to create something that made it for me - and that's how this project was created. It's working 24/7 since December 2019 :)

## Features

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/project_watchmychicken/4.jpeg" alt="Result" class="post-images">

As it's possible to see in the previous picture when we open the app is displayed the main menu that allows us to select to play or manage profiles.
To manage profiles we could:
* Create/edit/delete profiles,
* take photos and use them on profiles,
* see all records from a profile
* and finally, select a profile.


Watch the final result on the following video.
