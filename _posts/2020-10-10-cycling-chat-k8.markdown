After some time being full-stack developer, I become a DevOps enthusiast. In order to improve my DevOps skills, I started to think of a new project with Kubernetes. So, since I had an older laptop with 2GB of RAM without a screen I remembered to create a Kubernetes cluster. With this laptop, I created a cluster with: my laptop as a master (with ubuntu) and this old laptop as a worker node (also with ubuntu).

## Description

Initially, I researched how to create a cluster and easily found some content to help me. After a few 
hours, I had my cluster fully installed. After configuring the cluster, I started creating a Spring Boot API with one endpoint (list all messages).<br>
I also created a Dockerfile to create a docker image. The last will have the application that is going
to be used by Kubernetes. After that, I created the YAML templates: the deployment and the service.
<br>Additionally, I used Helm to automate the release of the spring boot app and all Kubernetes templates.
Then I configured all necessary YAMLs to automate the release of the app. The main goal of the application is a Cycling Chat. 
So, I deployed a Postgresql statefulset with Helm. This way, it can save all published messages from another RabbitMQ statefulset (also deployed with Helm). Lastly, I created a Java Application to publish messages on RabbitMQ.
