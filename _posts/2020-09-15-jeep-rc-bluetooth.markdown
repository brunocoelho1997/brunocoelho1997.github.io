A project which controls a RC Jeep via Bluetooth with an Arduino Uno, two DC Motors and an Android via Bluetooth. The android project was created with Java using Android Studio.

## Features

[![Video of the final result](https://img.youtube.com/vi/57s6BJGj7tE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57s6BJGj7tE)

As it's possible to see on the video, with an Android smartphone and the RC turned on we are able to:
* Connect to the RC using bluetooth,
* turn left and right,
* accelerate 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%,
* and set a gear, to the front or to reverse.
