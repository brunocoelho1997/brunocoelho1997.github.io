Within my bachelor’s context, I developed a Naval Battle Game using Android. In this game, a user could play single-player and multiplayer.

## Features

The main menu is displayed when we open the app (as we see in the previous image). It allows us to select to play or manage profiles. To manage profiles, we could:
* Create/edit/delete profiles,
* take photos and use them on profiles,
* see all records from a profile
* and finally, select a profile.

When is selected to play, the game allows:
* playing single player, that is, with "artificial intelligence" (random),
* it allows playing multiplayer: playing with another player that would have the app on his phone. In this case, we could create or connect to a game.
