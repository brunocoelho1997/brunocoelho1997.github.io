A friend requested me to develop the firmware of a balance and an Android app. This balance will be used to know the weight of each dog's leg and create wheels dog chairs for dogs that need some help to walk.

## Description
I got supplied with an Arduino board and 16 cells/sensors (HX711) for this project. As is shown in the following pictures, on this project, the user can:
* Connect the app to the balance;
* See the weight of each leg (average of 4 cells);
* Tare the actual values;
* Export values, that is, share the actual values with a C# application (already developed by my friend). Additionally, the app will create a PDF.
